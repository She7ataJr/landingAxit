Landing Page Design Based on NTI Training Task
This project is a landing page created as part of a training task during my time at NTI. The task involved taking a specific theme provided by NTI and translating it into a functional and visually similar landing page using HTML and CSS

Purpose:
The goal of this project was to replicate the design of the provided theme as closely as possible while also ensuring responsiveness, interactivity, and clean, organized code.
